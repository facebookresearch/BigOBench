                framework overview: Given a coding problem and human solutions, the framework evaluates language models
                on three key tasks: (1) predicting time-space complexities of existing solutions, (2) generating new
                code that meets specified complexity requirements, and (3) ranking solutions against human-written code
                with similar complexity profiles. The complexity framework automatically validates model outputs by
                computing runtime distributions and curve coefficients.

            <p>
              We introduce <span style="font-variant: small-caps;"><strong>BigO(Bench)</strong></span>, a novel
              coding benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of generative language models in understanding and
              generating code with specified time and space complexities.
              This benchmark addresses the gap in current evaluations that often overlook the ability of models to
              comprehend and produce code constrained by computational complexity.
              <span style="font-variant: small-caps;"><strong>BigO(Bench)</strong></span> includes tooling to infer
              the algorithmic complexity of any Python function from profiling measurements, including human- or
              LLM-generated solutions.
              <span style="font-variant: small-caps;"><strong>BigO(Bench)</strong></span> also includes of set of
              3,105 coding problems and 1,190,250 solutions from Code Contests annotated with inferred (synthetic) time
              and space complexity labels from the complexity framework, as well as corresponding runtime and memory
              footprint values for a large set of input sizes.
              We present results from evaluating multiple state-of-the-art language models on this benchmark,
              highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling complexity requirements.
              In particular, token-space reasoning models are unrivaled in code generation but not in complexity
              understanding, hinting that they may not generalize well to tasks for which no reward was given at
              training time.

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Task</strong> Firstly, we introduce three tasks that evaluate a model's understanding of time
                and space complexities. For a given coding challenge and human solution, the model can be queried to a.
                predict time-space complexities, b. generate code that solves the challenge while adhering to a
                specified (known to be feasible) complexity, and c. on top of it ranks better than human solutions of
                the same challenge and complexity.</li>
              <li><strong>Dataset</strong> Secondly, we support training and evaluation on these tasks by the release of
                a dataset of 3,105 coding problems and 1,190,250 solutions from Code Contests, that includes time-space
                complexity labels, curve coefficients as well as runtime and memory profiling measurements.</li>
              <li><strong>Framework</strong> Thirdly, we release the code for our complexity inference framework, that
                takes a Python function and returns time and space complexities. It's a rule-based algorithm based on
                fuzzing, profiling, and regressing of major complexity classes (including multi-dimensional). This is
                what we used to produce ground truth labels for <span
                  style="font-variant: small-caps;"><strong>BigO(Bench)</strong></span>, which are statistically
                significant ground truth performance profiles and not theoretical complexities. This complexity
                evaluation framework achieves 92\% and 84\% match (with human annotated theoretical complexity)
                respectively on the time and space complexity test sets.</li>
              <li><strong>Benchmark</strong> Fourthly, we evaluate 12 popular models on our benchmark along fined-tuned
                ones and compare in details their performance: using our All@1 metric, DeepSeek-R1 Llama 70B achieves
                top scores 41.4% and 4.8% on time complexity prediction and generation, 3.4% on space complexity
                generation and is outperformed on space prediction by Llama 3.1 405B with 10.3%.</li>

              <strong>Figure 2</strong> Outline of the dynamic complexity inference framework. The framework takes a
              code snippet and a single example of inputs to this code snippet. Then, it processes the code snippet and
              proceeds with extensive inputs generation, based on the provided example of inputs: inputs are
              independently or interdependently increased in size, using several expansion methods that can be the
              identity or random, among else. This forms a queue of synthetic inputs on which to execute the provided
              code snippet. These executions happen independently in sandboxes, where runtime and memory footprint
              measures are taken. Once all the measures are collected, the framework can model the code snippet time and
              space dependencies to the different inputs. Using curve fitting, the time and space complexity of the code
              is computed on each input separately and then altogether. The global time and space complexity over all
              inputs is what is being returned.

          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div class="content has-text-justified" style="font-size: 80%;">
            <p>
              The time-space complexity framework is a rule-based algorithm that can process any Python function in
              order to infer its time and space complexities dynamically. As inputs, it takes a Python function along
              its function inputs and their corresponding dataclass, which are then processed and modified before being
              run while runtime and memory footprints are measured.
              From a high-level perspective, the framework increases the size of inputs following various strategies, in
              order to assess the impact of their size on execution metrics (e.g. execution time, memory used).
              When the function has several arguments, they can be expanded independently or together to determine the
              overall complexity of the function, taking into account potential interdependencies.
              The prepared code, along with the various sets of expanded inputs are queued up and run in independent
              sandboxes, using the Bubblewrap library, to avoid any harmful side effects of the code being run. While
              running, Cprofiler is used for time execution measures and tracemalloc for memory footprint.
              Using non-negative least squares curve fitting on each set of measures, the coefficients and residuals of
              each complexity class are computed. The gold complexity class output for a given set of measures is chosen
              as the minimizer of the residuals, taking into account a simplicity bias (the more simple the complexity
              class is, the smaller the simplicity bias).
              This curve fitting is applied on each set of measures, each corresponding to a different subset of
              arguments being expanded with a different expansion method.
              Using ensemble methods, the global complexity of the Python function is computed by aggregating the
              individual complexity outputs along the different set of measures.
              Finally, the complexity framework also returns the coefficients of the curve of each elected complexity.
              These coefficients can be leveraged to rank and classify the optimisations of different Python solutions
              within the same complexity class. More details and set up instructions are shared on Github.

          <h2 class="title is-4" style="text-align: left;">Complexity Prediction</h2>
          <div class="content has-text-justified" style="font-size: 80%;">
            The first evaluation task of the benchmark, "Complexity Prediction", consists in predicting the time and
            space complexity given a problem description and a human solution. Our baseline for this task is the naive
            model that always returns O(n), the most frequent class. Pass@k measures the accuracy of finding the correct
            complexity; Best@k measures accuracy only across the most optimized complexity class of each problem; All@k
            requires correct complexity output across all complexity classes at once per problem.
          </div>
          <h2 class="title is-4" style="text-align: left;">Complexity Generation</h2>
          <div class="content has-text-justified" style="font-size: 80%;">
            The second task "Complexity Generation" requires the LLM to generate a correct solution to a given problem
            description that has to respect a feasible time or space complexity requirement. Our baseline for this task
            is a Llama 3.1 70B model that is queried for the same prompts without the complexity requirement. Pass@k
            measures the accuracy of finding a correct solution, according to public, private and generated tests, that
            has the correct complexity, as measured by the complexity framework; Best@k and All@k are similarly defined
            as their counterparts in the results of the first task.
          </div>
          <h2 class="title is-4" style="text-align: left;">Complexity Coefficient Percentile Ranking</h2>
          <div class="content has-text-justified" style="font-size: 80%;">
            The third task, "Complexity Coefficient Percentile Ranking", measures how a generated solution to a given
            problem, respecting a complexity requirement, ranks among human solutions of the same complexity class and
            problem. The ranking is performed based on the coefficient of the complexity curve, as measured by the
            framework: the lower the coefficient, the more flat the complexity curve and the more optimized the
            solution. Ranking results are given in percentile of the distribution, where a solution of the nth
            percentile is more optimized than n% of human solutions. The querying is similar to the second task with the
            addition of the requirement "Try to optimize the runtime of your code as much as you can, while respecting
            the time complexity requirement".

              We also highlight that as models improve, this generate-and-filter approach can be used to create future benchmarks that are more difficult and test other aspects of program execution.

              "Complexity Generation" compared to the individual tasks "Program Synthesis" and "Complexity Prediction".
              Across all tasks, the top performing model remains DeepSeek-R1 Llama 70B with 64.2 and 29.2 Pass@1 on
              respectively time prediction and generation, except on space prediction where models tend to overthink and
              misunderstand the notion of extra space complexity, though explicitly described in the test prompts.
              Models tend to be even more misled when asked to "Optimize the solution while respecting the complexity
              requirement", which leads to average 12% loss of performance for time generation All@1 in Table:

              <strong>Table 2</strong> Using the complexity framework, the best measured coefficient of the complexity
              curve, out of 20 attempts, is used to rank LLM-generated code among human solutions from the same problem
              and time-space complexity class. Ranking is percentile based, n% ranking score amounts for n% human
              solutions having worse complexity coefficient. If no LLM solution passes correctness tests, ranking score
              is set to 0. INTERSEC is the subset where all starred models have at least one successful solution.

                For base models, performance on HumanEval and CRUXEval are correlated. However, 
                finetuning breaks this correlation: distilled models (WizardCoder, Phind, Phi)
                significantly beat their base models on HumanEval but not CRUXEval.

                Performance on CRUXEval-I and CRUXEval-O are very correlated. Because the 
                tasks seem relatively different, this suggests that the code reasoning capabilities 
                of models may generalize across tasks.

                When comparing the predictions of different models, strong positive correlations
                are seen between sizes of the same model, between models of the same size, and 
                between instruct and base models. On average, samples that are harder for one model
                tend to be harder for other models, but worse models succeed on some examples where
                better models fail completely, showing the idiosyncrasies of each model's failures.

                Using CoT led to some improvements, with larger boosts on output prediction 
                than input prediction. GPT-4 benefits significantly more from CoT than other 
                models, achieving the highest pass@1 of 74.8% on input prediction and 81.9% on 
                output prediction.

            <p>
                CoT increases the diversity of generated inputs and outputs, so models 
                with CoT see a larger gap between pass@1 and pass@5 score compared to 
                models without.

            <p>
                We also investigate the impact of CoT on individual samples. We classify a 
                model's performance on an example as ‚Äúpoor‚Äù if the model gets that example 
                wrong over half the time, and ‚Äúgood‚Äù otherwise. For Code Llama 13B/34B and GPT-3.5,
                we find many individual samples where CoT actually hurts the prediction accuracy. 
                This is less the case for GPT-4, where CoT improves performance for most samples.

                After fine-tuning Code Llama 34B on assertions very similar to those in
                our benchmark, it can match the performance of GPT-4 on both input and 
                output prediction. However, accuracy plateaus at under 70% for both tasks, 
                so simple finetuning is far from solving the benchmark.
