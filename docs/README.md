## 🔎 Sample Explorer <sub><sup>([back to root](../README.md#-project-overview-back-to-top))<sub><sup>

The following code allows to deploy the website of BigO(Bench).
Notice that changing the data in `./data` can allow you to review some data provided by some models, or ground truth answers as annotated by the framework. The framework is directly usable as a review platform (though it can not collect any data).
When navigating the examples, feel free to use the keys to navigate across problems and corresponding classes of complexity.
